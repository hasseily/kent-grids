# About Repository
The project uses VS 2022 in x86 mode (to use x64 you'd need to make changes)

If you try to run the program, you'll get some DLL file missing errors.
You need to copy all the DLLs from Dependencies/SDL2/dll/x86 into your executable's directory.
The executable directory should be from the top level: bin/Win32/Debug
